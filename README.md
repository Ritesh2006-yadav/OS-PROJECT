# OS-PROJECT
We are working on Efficient page replacement algorithm simulator 
This project is a simulation tool designed to demonstrate how different Page Replacement Algorithms work in an operating system’s virtual memory management.The simulator visualizes page faults, frame updates, and the overall performance of each algorithm, helping students and developers clearly understand the internal workings of paging.
